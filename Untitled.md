# Assignment 7

## A. Summarize the 7th Class. (submit)  

As the class was, we finished the exercise for merging sentences, which was a good way to make up for our grammar. During the exercise, we discussed in groups, they are very excellent in grammar and i made some mistakes. In fact, i am very happy to be a member of this group to learn English. 

The second thing is that the Mr. Liu tell us how to memorize a paragraph of text in very short time, that is, to memorize their meanings firstly and then the English expression is on the way. Thatâ€™s a good method.
